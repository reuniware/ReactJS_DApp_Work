# ReactJS_DApp_Work
Experimental stuff in ReactJS around DApp programming (Ethereum and Eth-compatible blockchains).

# What has been done
I'm studying the AvaxStaker.finance dapp and trying to understand how it works so I started with the Solidity code that I deployed to the Ethereum Ropsten test network.

Then I have coded some stuff around the deployed smart contract.

These pieces of code will be useful for those who need to understand how to interact with a deployed smart contract on an ethereum-compatible blockchain, from a ReactJS project.

The UI is awesomely ugly, sorry for that :)
